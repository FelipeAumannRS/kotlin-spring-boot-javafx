# Kotlin JavaFX Spring Boot Project

![Hexagonal Architecture Diagram](./Untitled%20Diagram%20%282%29.jpg)

## Overview

This project is a Kotlin-based application that leverages the power of JavaFX for its user interface and Spring Boot for its backend services. The architecture follows the principles of Hexagonal Architecture (also known as Ports and Adapters) to ensure a clean separation of concerns and high testability.

## Core Technologies

### Kotlin
- **Kotlin**: A modern programming language that makes developers happier. It is concise, safe, interoperable with Java, and provides many ways to reuse code between multiple platforms for productive programming.

### Spring Boot
- **Spring Boot**: A framework that allows the creation of production-ready applications quickly. It provides a wide range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projects (e.g., embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, externalized configuration).

### Spring AOP
- **Spring AOP**: Aspect-Oriented Programming framework for modularizing cross-cutting concerns such as logging, transaction management, and security.

### Spring Web
- **Spring Web**: Provides comprehensive support for building web applications. It is part of the Spring Framework and enables the development of RESTful web services and applications.

### Spring Data
- **Spring Data**: Simplifies data access and interaction with databases. It provides a consistent approach to data access, with support for various databases and repositories.

### JavaFX
- **JavaFX**: A software platform for creating and delivering desktop applications, as well as rich Internet applications (RIAs) that can run across a wide variety of devices. JavaFX is intended to replace Swing as the standard GUI library for Java SE.

### H2 Database
- **H2 Database**: A lightweight, embedded, and open-source relational database management system written in Java. It can be used in embedded mode or in server mode.

### OkHttp
- **OkHttp**: An HTTP client thatâ€™s efficient by default, speeding up the connections with HTTP/2, connection pooling, and transparent GZIP.

## Functionality

This application provides the following key features:

1. **User Management**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. Each user has a balance that they can manage.
2. **Transaction Management**: Users can transfer money to other users. Each transaction updates the sender's and recipient's balances accordingly.
3. **Transaction History**: Users can view a history of all their transactions, showing the details of each transaction.
4. **User Notifications**: Users receive notifications for successful operations like login, sign-up, and transactions.

## Project Structure

The project follows a structured approach to ensure a clear separation of concerns and high maintainability.

### Layers

1. **Core**
    - **Entities**: Business entities like `UserEntity` and `TransactionEntity`.
    - **Use Cases**: Business logic encapsulated in services like `UserUseCase` and `TransactionUseCase`.

2. **Input Adapters**
    - **Web Controllers**: REST controllers to handle HTTP requests, like `UserController` and `TransactionController`.

3. **Output Adapters**
    - **Persistence Adapters**: Repositories and data mappers for database interactions, like `UserRepository` and `TransactionRepository`.

4. **Frameworks & Drivers**
    - **JavaFX**: For building the user interface.
    - **Spring Boot**: For building and running the backend services.

### Dependencies

The project dependencies are managed using Maven. The `pom.xml` file lists all the necessary dependencies required for the project, such as Spring Boot starters, JavaFX libraries, OkHttp client, Jackson for JSON processing, and JFoenix for enhanced UI components.
